## Different types of software development models
* Waterfall
    * Linear production flow, outdated
* Agile development
    * Letting the client side in on the development process. Possible to go back and forth
    * Adaptable to changes
* Kanban
    * Using a Kanban board to get a better overview and make it easier to focus on the task at hans
    * Popular in SCRUM
* SCRUM
    * 2-4 weeks of highly focused sprints focusing on very specific goals
* LEAN
    * Designed for fast delivery & minimum waste

## Waterfall

Waterfall is a linear way of developing and is therefor not particularly iterative and flexible.
The progress flows mostly in one direction through the six stages.

* Requirements
    * Captured in a product requirements document
* Analysis
    * Resulting in models, schema, and business rules
* Design
    * Software architecture
* Coding
    * The development, proving and integration of software
* Testing
    * Systematic discovery and debugging of defects in the software
* Operations
    * the installation, migration, support and maintenance of complete systems

This model is from an 1970 article by [Winston W. Royce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_W._Royce).

##### Supporting Arguments
The linear development reduces cost at later stages of the development. As there is no need to fix
problems before the end of the development.

Another bonus is the requirements for documentation necessary as well as source code. This makes the loss
of a team member easier to recover from other methods that doesn't have that much emphasis on
documentation and therefor a lot of knowledge lost. The waterfall model provides a structured approach
as the model itself progresses linearly through easy to explain phases and is thus easy to understand.
Because of this it's a first example of software engineering texts and courses.

##### Criticism
Clients might not know exactly what their requirements are before they see a working software and are thus
often changed in the middle of development and towards the end. Leading to redesign and redevelopment.
Something that increases cost.

Designers are not always aware of the difficulties ahead when designing a new feature or product.
Which the can lead to revising of design.

## Fusion

##### Short
The method integrates and extends the best features of earlier OO methods. It's a full
coverage method, providing a direct route from requirements definition through analysis and design
to a programming language implementation.

##### Key attributes for EVO

1. Multiobjective driven
2. Early, frequent iteration
3. Complete analysis, design, build, and test in each step
4. User orientation
6. Systems approach, not merely algorithm orientation
5. Open-ended basic systems architecture
7. Result orientation, not software development process orientation


## RUP

Rational Unified Process divides the development process into four distinct phases that each involve
business modeling, analysis and design, implementation, testing and deployment. RUP development methodology 
provides structured way for companies to envision create software programs. Since it provides a 
specific plan for each step of the development process.

##### Phases
1. Inception
    * Idea for the project is stated. Dev team determines if the project is worth pursuing and what
    resources are needed.
2. Elaboration
    * Project architecture and required resources are further evaluated. Devs consider possible application
    of the software and costs associated with the development.
3. Construction
    * Project is developed and completed. The software is designed, written and tested
4. Transition
    * Software is released to the public Final adjustments and updates are made based on feedback from end 
    users
  
#### Business modelling
* Opprette en bedre forst√•else og kommunikasjon mellom forretnings
utviklere og software utviklere.
